What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?

Normal HTML Elements:

Purpose: Normal HTML elements are generic and used primarily for layout and presentation purposes.
Meaning: They do not convey specific meaning about the content they encapsulate.
Examples: <div>, <span>, <p>, <b>, <i>, <table>, <img>, <a>, etc.
Usage: Normal HTML elements are versatile and can be styled using CSS to achieve desired visual effects.
Accessibility: They may not provide meaningful information to assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) about the role or purpose of the content.
Semantic HTML Elements:

Semantic HTML elements:
Purpose: Semantic HTML elements have specific meanings that convey the purpose and structure of the content they wrap.
Meaning: They provide context and clarity to both developers and web browsers about the content they contain.
Examples: <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <main>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>, etc.
Usage: Semantic HTML elements are designed to represent different sections and components of a web page based on their semantic meaning.
Accessibility: Semantic HTML elements improve accessibility by conveying important information to assistive technologies, making web content more usable for people with disabilities.

Key Differences:
Purpose: Normal HTML elements are primarily used for layout and styling, while semantic HTML elements define the structure and meaning of the content.
Meaning: Semantic HTML elements have specific semantic meaning, conveying the role and purpose of the content for better understanding.
Clarity and Maintainability: Semantic HTML promotes cleaner, more readable code by providing meaningful labels for different sections of a web page.
Accessibility: Semantic HTML enhances accessibility by helping assistive technologies interpret content accurately, improving usability for all users.

In summary, semantic HTML elements play a crucial role in defining the structure, meaning, and accessibility of web content. 
By using semantic elements appropriately, web developers can create more meaningful, usable, and maintainable websites that benefit both users and search engines.
